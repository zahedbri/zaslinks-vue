## NetlifyCMS configuration

![NetlifyCMS](/.vuepress/dist/vuepress-deploy.jpg)

In '.vuepress/public/config.yml' change the repo name

```
backend:
  name: github
  repo: capriosa/vuepress-deploy
  branch: master
```

Then add an Oauth app to your github account: https://github.com/settings/developers
For the Authorization callback URL, enter https://api.netlify.com/auth/done.

When you complete the registration, you’ll be given a Client ID and a Client Secret for the app. You’ll need to add these to your Netlify project:

```
Go to your Netlify dashboard and click on your project.
Navigate to Settings > Access control > OAuth.
Under Authentication Providers, click Install Provider.
Select GitHub and enter the Client ID and Client Secret, then save.
```

Now you can loggin to your NetlifyCMS with '/admin' after the URL of your site.
